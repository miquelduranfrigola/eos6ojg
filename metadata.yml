Title: AntibioticDB similarity matches matches
Description: Check whether compounds match with known antibiotics available from GARDP's
  AntibioticDB database. The tool simply performs Morgan fingerprint (radius 2, 1024 bits) with the Tanimoto similarity. Multiple similarity cutoffs are tested.
  The model also performs a simple (Naive Bayes) binary classification based on Murcko and BRICS scaffolds.
